              </p>
              
              <h3>For Hair</h3>
              <h4>Deep Conditioning Treatment</h4>
              <p>
                For an intensive hair treatment that addresses damaged or extremely dry hair:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Warm 2-3 tablespoons of Batana oil (amount depends on hair length)</li>
                <li>Apply thoroughly to dry hair, focusing on mid-lengths and ends</li>
                <li>Gently massage into the scalp in circular motions</li>
                <li>Cover with a shower cap or warm towel to enhance absorption</li>
                <li>Leave for 1-2 hours or overnight for maximum benefits</li>
                <li>Wash with a gentle shampoo, possibly twice to remove all oil</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This treatment can be done weekly for damaged hair or bi-weekly for maintenance.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Frizz Control Serum</h4>
              <p>
                To tame frizz and add shine to styled hair:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Place a few drops of Batana oil on your palms</li>
                <li>Rub hands together to warm and distribute the oil</li>
                <li>Lightly run your hands over styled hair, focusing on ends and areas prone to frizz</li>
                <li>Use sparingly - a little goes a long way</li>
              </ol>
              
              <div className="my-8 border-l-4 border-[#588157] pl-4 italic bg-neutral-50 p-4">
                <p className="m-0"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For fine hair, apply a minimal amount only to the ends to avoid weighing hair down.</p>
              </div>
              
              <h3>For Face</h3>
              <h4>Oil Cleansing Method</h4>
              <p>
                Batana oil works beautifully as part of an oil cleansing routine:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Pour a quarter-sized amount of Batana oil onto dry palms</li>
                <li>Massage into dry face for 1-2 minutes, focusing on areas with makeup or sunscreen</li>
                <li>The oil will dissolve makeup, sunscreen, and excess sebum</li>
                <li>Wet hands with warm water and continue massaging to emulsify the oil</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly with warm water</li>
                <li>Follow with a gentle water-based cleanser if desired (double cleansing method)</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4>Facial Massage Enhancement</h4>
              <p>
                To improve circulation and reduce facial tension:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Apply 4-5 drops of Batana oil to cleansed, slightly damp skin</li>
                <li>Use fingertips to perform gentle upward strokes along the contours of your face</li>
                <li>Pay special attention to areas of tension like the jaw and forehead</li>
                <li>Use the knuckles to gently roll along the cheekbones and brow bone</li>
                <li>Finish by pressing firmly on pressure points at the temples and between the eyebrows</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This facial massage technique increases the effectiveness of the oil while providing relaxation benefits.
              </p>
              
              <h3>For Body</h3>
              <h4>Post-Sun Exposure Relief</h4>
              <p>
                Batana oil can help soothe and restore skin after sun exposure:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>After sun exposure, take a cool shower</li>
                <li>While skin is still damp, apply a generous layer of Batana oil</li>
                <li>Pay special attention to areas that received the most sun</li>
                <li>Reapply as needed if skin feels tight or dry</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The oil's rich content of antioxidants helps neutralize free radicals from UV exposure while providing deep hydration.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Nail and Cuticle Care</h4>
              <p>
                Strengthen nails and soften cuticles:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Warm a small amount of Batana oil between your fingertips</li>
                <li>Massage into nails and cuticles</li>
                <li>Leave overnight for deeper conditioning</li>
                <li>For an intensive treatment, apply oil, then wear cotton gloves overnight</li>
              </ol>
              
              <div className="my-8 border-l-4 border-[#588157] pl-4 italic bg-neutral-50 p-4">
                <p className="m-0"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Batana oil can be mixed with a few drops of lavender or tea tree essential oil for added benefits and aroma when used as a cuticle treatment.</p>
              </div>
              
              <h3>Mixing and Customization</h3>
              <p>
                Batana oil works beautifully on its own, but can also be customized:
              </p>
              
              <h4>Custom Hair Mask</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>For growth:</strong> Mix 2 tablespoons Batana oil with 1 tablespoon castor oil and 3 drops rosemary essential oil</li>
                <li><strong>For repair:</strong> Combine 2 tablespoons Batana oil with 1 tablespoon honey and 1 egg yolk</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Custom Face Serum</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>For mature skin:</strong> Mix 10 ml Batana oil with 5 drops frankincense essential oil and 3 drops lavender essential oil</li>

              </ul>
              
              <h3>Storage and Shelf Life</h3>
              <p>
                To preserve the potency of your Batana oil:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Store in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight</li>
                <li>Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use</li>
                <li>Pure Batana oil typically has a shelf life of 12-18 months when properly stored</li>
                <li>If the oil develops an unusual smell or appears cloudy, it may have oxidized and should be replaced</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
