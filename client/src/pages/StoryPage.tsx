              <h3>The Discovery</h3>
              <p>
                Our journey began when our founder, Elena, was traveling through La Mosquitia, the easternmost region of Honduras. While staying with a Miskito community, she noticed the extraordinarily healthy hair and skin of the local women, despite their limited access to commercial beauty products.
              </p>
              <p>
                She learned that they used an oil extracted from the American palm fruit (Elaeis oleifera), which they called "Batana." The oil was made through a labor-intensive process that had been passed down through generations of Miskito women.

              <h3>The Tradition</h3>
              <p>
                For centuries, Miskito women have harvested the fruit of the American palm, extracting its oil through a meticulous process:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>The ripe fruits are collected and their seeds removed</li>
                <li>The pulp is boiled in water until the oil separates</li>
                <li>The oil is carefully skimmed off the surface</li>
                <li>This process is repeated several times to purify the oil</li>
                <li>The final product is stored in calabash gourds for use</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This traditional method preserves all the beneficial properties of the oil while ensuring its purity.
              </p>
              
              <h3>Our Mission</h3>
              <p>
                Inspired by the transformative properties of Batana oil and the rich cultural heritage behind it, Elena returned to the United States with a vision: to create a company that would bring this extraordinary oil to a wider audience while supporting the indigenous communities who have been its stewards for generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pure Batana was founded on three core principles:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality</strong> - Maintaining the traditional methods that preserve the oil's potency</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Ensuring responsible harvesting practices that protect the rainforest</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Trade</strong> - Providing fair compensation and economic opportunities for Miskito communities</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>The Partnership</h3>
              <p>
                We established direct partnerships with Miskito communities in La Mosquitia, creating a cooperative model that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pays a premium well above market rates for the oil</li>
                <li>Invests in community infrastructure like schools and healthcare</li>
                <li>Provides training in sustainable harvesting techniques</li>
                <li>Supports women's economic independence through employment opportunities</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These partnerships ensure that as our business grows, the benefits flow back to the communities who have shared their traditional knowledge with us.
              </p>
